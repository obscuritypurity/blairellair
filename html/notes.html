<h4>March 28, 2024 -- first post!</h4>

<p>Hello! Welcome to the site.<br><br>

It's funny to think about the HTML website as a 'thing of the past'. The main influence behind this site, Jens Lekman's <a href='https://www.jenslekman.com/records/smalltalk.htm'>Small Talk Blog</a>, hasn't been updated in a few years at the time of writing. And I struggle to think of other websites I've come back to over the years that still even go no-js, like <a href="https://ubuweb.com">UbuWeb</a> (which sadly is no longer, at least in terms of new content.)<br><br>

And so I forge on with this, obsolete upon arrival. But then that is what makes the creation of this website interesting to me. Not only to see how things work, but to also to create something of my own, of my own volition, much in the same way that I create my art.<br><br>

And perhaps, something to look back on too, as the years themselves forge on.<br><br>
