<h4>July 1, 2024 -- new record, and new project</h4>

<p>Sharing a new record this evening, and in turn, the start of a new project called Wellerfield.<br><br>

You can read more about the project on <a href="wellerfield.thml">the Wellerfield page</a>. As for the album, <i>Instinctive Sketches of West Folkertown</i>, you can check it out on Bandcamp <a href="https://blairellair.bandcamp.com">here.</a> Thanks for checking it out!

In other news, three months have gone by and I still can't get the fonts correct. This will probably take me a considerable amount of time to figure out, knowing my other priorities.</p>

<h4>April 14, 2024 -- updates to stuff</h4>

<p>Added in some links to writing materials.<br><br>

Still can't get the fonts right. But will look to fix soon.</p>

<h4>March 28, 2024 -- first post!</h4>

<p>Hello! Welcome to the site.<br><br>

It's funny to think about the HTML website as a 'thing of the past'. The main influence behind this site, Jens Lekman's <a href='https://www.jenslekman.com/records/smalltalk.htm'>Small Talk Blog</a>, hasn't been updated in a few years at the time of writing. And I struggle to think of other websites I've come back to over the years that still even go no-js, like <a href="https://ubuweb.com">UbuWeb</a> (which sadly is no longer, at least in terms of new content.)<br><br>

And so I forge on with this, obsolete upon arrival. But then that is what makes the creation of this website interesting to me. Not only to see how things work, but to also to create something of my own, of my own volition, much in the same way that I create my art.<br><br>

And perhaps, something to look back on too, as the years themselves forge on.<br><br>
