!Good morning! Today we have sun mixed with rain. It is a pinkish rain today in Folkertown, class 6A temperature, common for the summertime.
Today’s top agilata: new water animal (call for translation: ?fish?) discovered off coast of Tomfolken inlet. Concerns that it is a potential invader from east. Covered in Isoata Tanogog. May lead to further inbound discoveries in far-out regions.
Official thanks to be sent regarding Earth dimensions and structure (sphereical.) Potential convincing of authorities at Tomfolken to develop a first-class world ship – previous experiments have proven to be failures.

Today’s top agilata: award ceremony for music of pincallata origin. Popular in Sudenisle regions but has become popular in Folker over the last ten seasons. **

** last ten seasons [translator note :: expression in Folkeran. Doesn’t always mean the amount stated.]

Covered in Drabano EZ in the fall edition sweep. It is a good day today, lots of sun. Listened to “Horse With No Name” from earlier transcript. Mostly static but otherwise some light sounds from what might be described as percussive. Unfamiliar musical notation, we will be studying it.
Sensors indicate current inability to transmit audio but can code it in. Instructions sent by [GH-B] on proper deliverance. Until next time.

Evening share: news from Tomfolken indicate central government meetup with eastern coalition. Indications that there may be frequencies delivered from other governments in the future. Our current contact remains secretive amongst a few officials.

It is just me up here, alone in the control room, speaking into the black unknown above. I have been communicating with a few of you on Earth for some time now. Tell me in your next reply, is there a word for this feeling in your language? I mean the feeling in which you are alone, and you must be secretive but you don’t want to be, you cannot even tell your lover.

And you can barely even tell your higher-ups. But, I guess that’s not as bad.

Folker S.R.A. will likely approve me to clear names in the coming days. After that, I will be able to tell you my name. I’m not sure why, but being able to tell you would give me a lift from my shoulders greater than anything else in my life right now, and I await that day in eager anticipation.
